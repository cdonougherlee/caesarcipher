# Caesar Cipher Website
A simple website to encrypt and decrypt text using the famous Caesar cipher.

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my skills and understanding of the Bootstrap front-end framework as well as vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. The site is repsonsive, uses Bootstrap classes all throughout and will respond to user input in real time.
